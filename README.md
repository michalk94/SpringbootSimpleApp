# SpringbootSimpleApp
This is my first simple project using Spring Boot with only backend code.
Project is still during production so I'm gonna add new features in the future for sure.
I used Spring Boot because it's one of the best tools for microservices.
Mastering Spring and Spring Boot is my main goal atm.
There are other technologies used in this project e.q. MySql and Spring JDCB.
I've decided to use Spring JDBC and not Hibernate because I want to focus on one technologie at the time.


Project is still under development so I will add more information in the future.
Stay tuned!!!
